# Libft 📚
This is a personal archive containing an upgraded version of the **Libft** project from the old 42 curriculum.<br>
This repository is **not intended for submission, re-evaluation, reuse, or distribution**.<br>
It is stored as a minimally organized record of the learning process at that time.

## Scope of Responsibility and Applicability ⚠️
- The primary development environment is **macOS**.
  While the original 42 campus environment used Ubuntu, this repository is **not maintained for submission purposes**. Operation on other environments is not guaranteed.
- This project is maintained **solely for archival and learning purposes**.
  It is not intended for reuse, redistribution, or use in production environments.
- 42 coding standards (**Norminette**) are intentionally disregarded.
  They are no longer relevant to this archive.
- This code has **not been reviewed for submission** within the 42 curriculum.
- The program is designed as a **short-lived process**.
  Due to limited memory usage, thorough memory cleanup is not a design goal.
  Resource release is left to the OS kernel upon process termination.
- This code is not intended to provide the high robustness, security guarantees, or defensive programming required for long-running or production systems.
- No future feature development or long-term maintenance is planned.
